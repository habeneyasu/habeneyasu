# 🚀 Haben Eyasu Akelom
**Senior Software & Machine Learning Engineer | AI Systems & Fintech Infrastructure**

I design and deploy production-grade AI systems and high-scale financial infrastructure with a security-first architecture.

---

### 🛠 What I Build
* **Production LLM Systems:** RAG orchestration, fine-tuning workflows, and model evaluation.
* **High-Scale Fintech APIs:** Secure, high-throughput microservices for regulated environments.
* **Reliable MLOps Pipelines:** End-to-end experiment tracking, reproducibility, and monitoring.
* **Hardened Agent Frameworks:** Safe tool-execution layers with validation, sandboxing, and RCE mitigation.

---

### 🤖 AI & ML Engineering
* **LLM Orchestration:** RAG system design (FAISS, ChromaDB), agentic workflows, and prompt engineering.
* **Fine-tuning:** QLoRA/LoRA workflows and model quantization for production efficiency.
* **MLOps & Tooling:** MLflow, DVC, FastAPI, Docker, and real-time observability.

### 🔧 Software Architecture & Scale
* **Backend & Scale:** Java (Spring Boot), Python (FastAPI), Kafka, Redis, and PostgreSQL.
* **Enterprise Scale:** Architected systems processing **8M+ monthly transactions** with integrations across **30+ financial institutions** and **7 telecommunication operators**.
* **Security & Identity:** OAuth2/JWT, AES-256 encryption, RBAC, and secure command execution.

---

### 🚀 Selected Impact
* **Credit Scoring Engine:** Architected an automated, ML-driven credit scoring system for multi-tenant banking platforms.
* **Causal Discovery:** Applied causal discovery techniques on financial inclusion datasets to model policy intervention impact.
* **Security Hardening:** Implemented validation layers for tool use in agentic frameworks to mitigate RCE vulnerabilities.
